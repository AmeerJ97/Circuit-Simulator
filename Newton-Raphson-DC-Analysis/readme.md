# Description
This section includes a Jacobian function to compute the derivative of a nonlinear function (Function that includes e.g diodes) as well as perform the DC analysis using the Newton-Raphson Method.
# Circuit components
This function can perform the DC analysis on Resistors, Capacitors, Voltage Sources, Current Sources, and Diodes.
