# LU factorization function 
Takes in input of a square matrix A and decomposes it providing the Lower (L) and Upper (U) Matricies. Such that:
A = LU

## Computational Relevance
This function is useful as matrix inversion is not numerically stable for certain sizes of the input matrix. Furthermore, LU decomposition makes solving any linear systems computationally much faster.
